# AB Fab

AB Fab is a gem for A/B testing with persistence to Redis.

Currently, it is NOT Fab, and should not be used by anyone for any reason.

## Goals
* Easy to use.
* Fast.
* Simple - no dependencies aside from Redis and the `redis-rb` gem.
* Durable - apps shouldn't go down if the Redis connection is lost.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'abfab'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install abfab
